						<h3>Back End Module 1, or as it is more commonly known: "Where's your growth mindset, noob."</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Whew! That Mod 1 Back End, amirite? Talk about a roller coaster of emotions. From riding the high of a victory on a project to trying not to fall into a pit of despair on the next project. Rinse and repeat for six weeks. At the end of it all though, I feel as if I've come out not only a better Ruby developer but a more confident learner in general.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can probably tell by now that we didn't do much work on visual design. I'm confident that those skills will come in time though. Out of the things we did work on, I've got to say that CompleteMe was my favorite project of the bunch. In the project, we had to put together a trie, also known as a prefix tree, and reproduce the functionality of a basic autocomplete program. This was the project that really started to hone my instincts for seeing the links between objects, abstract as they sometimes are. At first, it required extensive use of whiteboarding, but near the end, my partner and I were starting to be able to see the links between the nodes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not far behind on my list of favorite projects was BattleShip. On the surface this seemed pretty straightforward: recreate the functionality of the classic board game in Ruby. It ended up being a lot more complicated than I originally thought, especially when it came to coding the computer player's random ship placement. It was this part of the project where the utility of Ruby's Enumerables truly started to shine through the darkness. They really became my favorite technical concept of the module, since I didn't have to use for loops for everything.
            </p>
            <p>
                All in all, Mod 1 was a great experience. There were highs, and there were lows, but the experience and mentoring were invaluable.
